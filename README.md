1. AI-Generated Code Review: Python Data Processing Script

   Evaluate an AI-generated Python script designed to clean and process a CSV dataset. The script should handle missing values, remove duplicates, and normalize data.

   Tasks:
     Review the AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and readability.
     Identify potential bugs or edge cases (e.g., handling non-numeric data).
     Write a human-readable summary explaining strengths, weaknesses, and suggested improvements.

   Output:

2. Solving Coding Problems: Optimizing a JavaScript Function

   An AI model generated a JavaScript function to find the longest substring without repeating characters, but it has performance issues.

   Tasks:
     Rewrite the function to improve time complexity (from O(nÂ²) to O(n)).
     Explain the optimizations made in a summary.

   Output:
